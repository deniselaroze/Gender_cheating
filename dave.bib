In addition to a baseline treatment, in which subjects rolled a die in private and showed a high extent of dishonest behavior, we increased the degree of social control by a novel treatment in which subjects played in randomly assigned pairs of two. The presence of others proved to substantially, but only temporarily reduce dishonest behavior. Furthermore, one treatment group received feedback on unethical behavior of participants in a similar experiment. Knowing that others betrayed in the experiment facilitated social learning and led to a higher prevalence of cheating. Finally, increasing the degree of anonymity by re-running the experiment online increased the extent of norm transgressions slightly. "

In both variants of the game, cheating is invisible because subjects make their choices purely in their minds. The only difference stems from the ordering of steps that subjects are instructed to follow when playing the game. The order of play has a significant impact on cheating behavior, even though the rules cannot be enforced. "

    abstract = { This paper presents theory and experiments where people's prosocial attitudes fluctuate over time following the violation of an internalized norm. We report the results of two experiments in which people who first made an immoral choice were then more likely to donate to charity than those who did not. In addition, those who knew that a donation opportunity would follow the potentially immoral choice behaved more unethically than those who did not know. We interpret this increase in charitable behavior as being driven by a temporal increase in guilt induced by past immoral actions. We term such behavior conscience accounting and discuss its importance in charitable giving and in the identification of social norms in choice behavior through time inconsistency. Data, as supplemental material, are available at http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2014.1942. This paper was accepted by Teck-Hua Ho, behavioral economics. }

The choice-based measures better predicted real-world outcomes such as smoking and payment of credit card debt.

Advantages and disadvantages of both measures are discussed. Our findings are relevant for the design of experiments to measure time preferences.",

%abstract ={We examine whether men and women of the same ability differ in their selection into a competitive environment. Participants in a laboratory experiment solve a real task, first under a noncompetitive piece rate and then a competitive tournament incentive scheme. Although there are no gender differences in performance, men select the tournament twice as much as women when choosing their compensation scheme for the next performance. While 73 percent of the men select the tournament, only 35 percent of the women make this choice. This gender gap in tournament entry is not explained by performance, and factors such as risk and feedback aversion only playa negligible role. Instead, the tournament-entry gap is driven by men being more overconfident and by gender differences in preferences for performing in a competition. The result is that women shy away from competition and men embrace it.},

Method 13,324 adult (≥ 18 years) cigarette smokers from the USA, Canada, UK, and Australia from one of the first three waves (2002–2004) of the International Tobacco Control 4-Country survey were employed for the predictive analysis where beliefs measured in one wave (1–3) of a cohort were used to predict cessation outcomes in the next wave (2–4). Results Both types of belief were negatively associated with both intention to quit in the same wave and making a quit attempt at the next wave. When taken together and controlling for demographic factors, the risk-minimizing beliefs continued to be predictive, but the self-exempting belief was not. Some of the effects of risk-minimizing beliefs on quit attempts seem to be independent of intentions, but not consistently independent of other known predictors. There were no consistent predictive effects on sustained cessation among those who made attempts to quit for either measure. Conclusions Countering risk-minimizing beliefs may facilitate increased quitting, but this may not be so important for self-exempting beliefs. "

abstract ={Objective: There is a widespread assumption that smoking behaviour is largely established by the age of 18 years. As a result, smoking prevention has focused almost exclusively upon youth. However, recent trends suggest that young adulthood may be an important�and largely overlooked�period in the development of regular smoking behaviour. The current study sought to examine patterns of tobacco use among young adults (aged 18�29 years) and to address the implications for tobacco control policy.Design: Data are presented from the 2003 Canadian Tobacco Use Monitoring Survey, a national survey of smoking behaviour (n ?=? 10 559, response rate 89%).Main outcome measures: Measures of smoking behaviour, smoking initiation, susceptibility to smoking, and occupational status.Results: A total of 1.4 million or 28% of young adults in Canada currently smoke, the highest proportion among all age groups. The prevalence of daily smoking rose from 8% among youth to 22% among young adults, and approximately one fifth of smokers tried their first cigarette after the age of 18 years. Smoking behaviour among young adults was also distinct from older smokers: young adults were more likely to be occasional smokers and reported lower daily consumption. Finally, smoking prevalence and cessation rates varied substantially within subgroups of young adults, as characterised by occupational setting.Conclusions: Dramatic increases in the proportion and intensity of smoking occurs after the age of 18 years. Smoking behaviour among young adults is distinct from both youth and older adults, and warrants immediate attention from the public health community.},

volume = {1999}, 
number = {25}, 
pages = {15-20}, 
year = {1999}, 
abstract ={Risk communications are frequently intended to help people understand hazards they face, 
with the hope that this understanding will help them make better decisions about the need for 
action or help them choose among alternative actions. To evaluate the success of such 
communications, a definition of �understanding� is needed. This paper suggests 
that decisions about personal risks require, at a minimum, information about the nature and 
likelihood of potential ill effects, information about the risk factors that modify one's 
susceptibility, and information about the ease or difficulty of avoiding harm. Even if these 
attributes are accepted as essential criteria for understanding, research on risk perceptions 
suggests that assessing what people know or believe is sometimes quite difficult. The focus of the 
paper is on the several dimensions of risk comprehension. Examples of how each can be assessed

abstract ={A nationwide survey of 776 U.S. residents, divided approximately equally between teenagers and adults, smokers and nonsmokers, assessed public understanding of the illnesses caused by smoking. When respondents were asked what illnesses are caused by smoking, lung cancer was the only illness that could be identified by a clear majority of respondents. Roughly half mentioned emphysema. A much smaller percentage of respondents were able to mention any cardiovascular disease or any kind of cancer other than lung cancer. People also underestimated the death rate from lung cancer and overestimated survival duration. Only a minority realized that emphysema is incurable. Large portions of the sample said they knew only a little about the pain and suffering experienced by individuals with these illnesses. The results demonstrated that even though people recognize that smoking can lead to adverse health consequences, they do not have even a basic understanding of the nature and severity of these consequences.},

In particular, we ask if decision makers are blamed for being pivotal if they implement an unpopular outcome in a sequential voting process. We conduct an experimental voting game in which decision makers vote about the allocation of money between themselves and recipients without voting rights. We measure responsibility attributions for voting decisions by eliciting the monetary punishment that recipients assign to individual decision makers. We find that pivotal decision makers are punished significantly more for an unpopular voting outcome than non-pivotal decision makers. Our data also suggest that some voters avoid being pivotal by voting strategically in order to delegate the pivotal vote to subsequent decision makers. "

pages="281--298",
abstract="The aim of the paper is to explore and assess the process of responsibility, decoupling point, and disengagement of moral responsibility, in combination with business sustainability (BSus) in supply chains. The research is based on a qualitative approach consisting of two multifaceted case studies, each including multiple case companies and different empirical research characteristics, and a review of BSus in supply chain literature. The case studies apply moral disengagement (MDis) to propose how moral responsibility can deteriorate in supply chains, and the literature review identifies elements of BSus in supply chain management (SCM). The contribution of this paper is to compare these two research streams and evaluate the efficacy of the concepts proposed in the case studies. Through this study, BSus gains an entirely different and complementary toolkit which should facilitate further and more effective research in SCM. The theory of MDis also provides a foundation for reinforcing explanatory and prescriptive aspects of `best practices' in the SCM literature. The findings also establish a basis for organizing and monitoring supply chains so as to improve BSus efforts. Considering moral responsibility as a flow this research explains why and how certain practices may impede BSus efforts in supply chains. Original and/or innovative outcomes include explanatory and prescriptive insights that emerge from a combination of empirical findings from two case studies, including seven companies and a framework for improving BSus management in supply chains, based on a typology of moral disengagement.",

We find that if taxpayers' incomes are correlated (e.g., when they are subject to a common shock) the optimal audit probability for low declarations is an increasing function of the average declaration, as the latter is an informative signal of the realized level of income. Since a taxpayer's optimal declaration is an increasing function of the probability of an audit, the optimal auditing rule creates incentives for taxpayers to coordinate their declarations. The resulting coordination game features multiplicity of equilibria and thus �strategic uncertainty� about the equilibrium that will be selected.},

We employ a very simple task where participants face a trade-off between the joy of eating a fine chocolate and the disutility of having a threatened self-concept because of lying. Despite the incentives to cheat, we find that individuals are mostly honest. Further, international indices that are indicative of institutional honesty are completely uncorrelated with citizens' honesty for our sample countries. "

abstract ={Survey experiments, like vignette and conjoint analyses, are widely used in the social sciences to elicit stated preferences and study how humans make multidimensional choices. However, there is a paucity of research on the external validity of these methods that examines whether the determinants that explain hypothetical choices made by survey respondents match the determinants that explain what subjects actually do when making similar choices in real-world situations. This study compares results from conjoint and vignette analyses on which immigrant attributes generate support for naturalization with closely corresponding behavioral data from a natural experiment in Switzerland, where some municipalities used referendums to decide on the citizenship applications of foreign residents. Using a representative sample from the same population and the official descriptions of applicant characteristics that voters received before each referendum as a behavioral benchmark, we find that the effects of the applicant attributes estimated from the survey experiments perform remarkably well in recovering the effects of the same attributes in the behavioral benchmark. We also find important differences in the relative performances of the different designs. Overall, the paired conjoint design, where respondents evaluate two immigrants side by side, comes closest to the behavioral benchmark; on average, its estimates are within 2% percentage points of the effects in the behavioral benchmark.},

We develop new methods both for evaluating and choosing anchoring vignettes and for analyzing the resulting data.

Customers in a restaurant in tables of one or two diners who paid with cash received excessive change of either 10 or 40 Shekels (about \$3 or \$12). A majority of customers (128 out of 192) did not return the excessive change. Repeated customers returned the excessive change much more often than one-time customers. Women returned the extra change much more often than men, especially among repeated customers. Interestingly, a table with a woman and a man behaves similarly to one or two males and not to a female table. Surprisingly, tables with two diners were not significantly more likely to return the excessive change. Customers receiving 10 extra Shekels were much less likely to return them than those who received 40 extra Shekels, but it is hard to know to what extent this comes from intentional behavior versus lower likelihood to observe the extra change when it is lower. We also found evidence for variation in dishonesty as a function of the time during the day. "

	title = {Do Nonpartisan Programmatic Policies Have Partisan Electoral Effects? Evidence from Two Large Scale Randomized Experiments},
	year = {2016},
	abstract = {A vast literature demonstrates that voters around the world who benefit from their governments{\textquoteright} discretionary spending cast ballots for the incumbent party in larger proportions than those not receiving funds. But surprisingly, and contrary to most theories of political accountability, the evidence seems to indicate that voters also reward incumbent parties for implementing {\textquoteleft}{\textquoteleft}programmatic{\textquoteright}{\textquoteright} spending legislation, passed with support from all major parties, and over which incumbents have no discretion. Why voters would attribute responsibility when none exists is unclear, as is why minority party legislators would approve of legislation that will cost them votes. We address this puzzle with one of the largest randomized social experiments ever, resulting in clear rejection of the claim that programmatic policies greatly increase voter support for incumbents. We also reanalyze the study cited as claiming the strongest support for the electoral effects of programmatic policies, which is also a very large scale randomized experiment. We show that its key results vanish after correcting either a simple coding error affecting only two observations or highly unconventional data analysis procedures (or both). We also discuss how these consistent empirical results from the only two probative experiments on this question may be reconciled with several observational and theoretical studies touching on similar questions in other contexts.},

We associate large and significant changes in tax evasion following the flat tax reform with changes in voluntary compliance.

    abstract = {<p>This paper specifies, designs and critically evaluates two tools for the automated identification of demographic data (age, occupation and social class) from the profile descriptions of Twitter users in the United Kingdom (UK). Meta-data data routinely collected through the Collaborative Social Media Observatory (COSMOS: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cosmosproject.net/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.cosmosproject.net/</ext-link>) relating to UK Twitter users is matched with the occupational lookup tables between job and social class provided by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) using SOC2010. Using expert human validation, the validity and reliability of the automated matching process is critically assessed and a prospective class distribution of UK Twitter users is offered with 2011 Census baseline comparisons. The pattern matching rules for identifying age are explained and enacted following a discussion on how to minimise false positives. The age distribution of Twitter users, as identified using the tool, is presented alongside the age distribution of the UK population from the 2011 Census. The automated occupation detection tool reliably identifies certain occupational groups, such as professionals, for which job titles cannot be confused with hobbies or are used in common parlance within alternative contexts. An alternative explanation on the prevalence of hobbies is that the creative sector is overrepresented on Twitter compared to 2011 Census data. The age detection tool illustrates the youthfulness of Twitter users compared to the general UK population as of the 2011 Census according to proportions, but projections demonstrate that there is still potentially a large number of older platform users. It is possible to detect ``signatures'' of both occupation and age from Twitter meta-data with varying degrees of accuracy (particularly dependent on occupational groups) but further confirmatory work is needed.</p>},

However, most research so far ignores that language use is related to the social identity of speakers, which may be different from their biological identity. In this paper, we combine insights from sociolinguistics with data collected through an online game, to underline the importance of approaching age and gender as social variables rather than static biological variables. In our game, thousands of players guessed the gender and age of Twitter users based on tweets alone. We show that more than 10{\%} of the Twitter users do not employ language that the crowd associates with their biological sex. It is also shown that older Twitter users are often perceived to be younger. Our findings highlight the limitations of current approaches to gender and age prediction from texts.},

Thus the ability to classify latent user attributes, including gender, age, regional origin, and political orientation solely fromTwitter user language or similar highly informal content has important applications in advertising, personalization, and recommendation. This paper includes a novel investigation of stacked-SVM-based classification algorithms over a rich set of original features, applied to classifying these four user attributes. It also in- cludes extensive analysis of features and approaches that are effective and not effective in classifying user attributes in Twitter-style informal written genres as distinct from the other primarily spoken genres previously studied in the user- property classification literature. Our models, singly and in ensemble, significantly outperform baseline models in all cases. A detailed analysis of model components and fea- tures provides an often entertaining insight into distinctive language-usage variation across gender, age, regional origin and political orientation inmodern informal communication.},

In that more recent tradition we frame author age prediction from text as a regression problem. We explore the same task using three very different genres of data simultaneously: blogs, telephone conversations, and online forum posts. We employ a technique from domain adaptation that allows us to train a joint model involving all three corpora together as well as separately and analyze differences in predictive features across joint and corpus-specific aspects of the model. Effective features include both stylistic ones (such as POS patterns) as well as content oriented ones. Using a linear regression model based on shallow text features, we obtain correlations up to 0.74 and mean absolute errors between 4.1 and 6.8 years.},

abstract = {Transmitting messages in the most efficient way as possible has always been one of politicians' main concerns during electoral processes. Due to the rapidly growing number of users, online social networks have become ideal platforms for politicians to interact with their potential voters. Exploiting the available potential of these tools to maximize their influence over voters is one of politicians' actual challenges. To step in this direction, we have analyzed the user activity in the online social network Twitter, during the 2011 Spanish Presidential electoral process, and found that such activity is correlated with the election results. We introduce a new measure to study political sentiment in Twitter, which we call the relative support. We have also characterized user behavior by analyzing the structural and dynamical patterns of the complex networks emergent from the mention and retweet networks. Our results suggest that the collective attention is driven by a very small fraction of users. Furthermore, we have analyzed the interactions taking place among politicians, observing a lack of debate. Finally, we develop a network growth model to reproduce the interactions taking place among politicians.},

 abstract = {Since Aristotle, a vast literature has suggested that economic inequality has important political consequences. Higher inequality is thought to increase demand for government income redistribution in democracies and to discourage democratization and promote class conflict and revolution in dictatorships. Most such arguments crucially assume that ordinary people know how high inequality is, how it has been changing, and where they fit in the income distribution. Using a variety of large, cross-national surveys, we show that, in recent years, ordinary people have had little idea about such things. What they think they know is often wrong. Widespread ignorance and misperceptions of inequality emerge robustly, regardless of the data source, operationalization, and method of measurement. Moreover, we show that the perceived level of inequality�and not the actual level�correlates strongly with demand for redistribution and reported conflict between rich and poor. We suggest that most theories about political effects of inequality need to be either abandoned or reframed as theories about the effects of perceived inequality.},

It is only necessary to see the number of scientific publications and forums or related conferences to understand that this is a field with great prospects for the future. On the other hand, the Twitter boom has boosted investigation in this area due fundamentally to its potential applications in areas such as business or government intelligence, recommender systems, graphical interfaces and virtual assistance. However, to fully understand this issue, a profound revision of the state of the art is first necessary. It is for this reason that this paper aims to represent a starting point for those investigations concerned with the latest references to Twitter in SA.},

	Abstract = {Even though considerable attention has been given to the polarity of words (positive and negative) and the creation of large polarity lexicons, research in emotion analysis has had to rely on limited and small emotion lexicons. In this paper we show how the combined strength and wisdom of the crowds can be used to generate a large, high-quality, wordemotion and wordpolarity association lexicon quickly and inexpensively. We enumerate the challenges in emotion annotation in a crowdsourcing scenario and propose solutions to address them. Most notably, in addition to questions about emotions associated with terms, we show how the inclusion of a word choice question can discourage malicious data entry, help identify instances where the annotator may not be familiar with the target term (allowing us to reject such annotations), and help obtain annotations at sense level (rather than at word level). We conducted experiments on how to formulate the emotion- annotation questions, and show that asking if a term is associated with an emotion leads to markedly higher inter-annotator agreement than that obtained by asking if a term evokes an emotion.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we describe how we created two state-of-the-art SVM classifiers, one to de- tect the sentiment of messages such as tweets and SMS (message-level task) and one to de- tect the sentiment of a term within a message (term-level task). Among submissions from 44 teams in a competition, our submissions stood first in both tasks on tweets, obtaining an F-score of 69.02 in the message-level task and 88.93 in the term-level task. We imple- mented a variety of surface-form, semantic, and sentiment features.

Our theory shows that sociotropic voting is consistent with self-interested behavior. We test our theory using both cross-sectional and time- series survey data. A novel survey instrument that asks respondents their numerical assessment of the unemployment rate confirms that individuals' economic information responds to the economic conditions of people similar to themselves. Further, these assessments associate with individuals' vote choices. We also show in time-series data that state unemployment robustly correlates with evaluations of national economic conditions and presidential support.},

	Abstract = {In 2001 and 2003, the Bush administration engineered two enormous tax cuts primarily benefiting very wealthy taxpayers.Most Americans supported these tax cuts. I argue that they did so not because they were indifferent to economic inequality, but because they largely failed to connect inequality and public policy. Three out of every four people polled said that the difference in incomes between rich people and poor people has increased in the past 20 years, and most of them added that that is a bad thing---but most of those people still supported the regressive 2001 Bush tax cut and the even more regressive repeal of the estate tax. Several mani- festly relevant considerations had negligible or seemingly perverse effects on these policy views, including assessments of the waste- fulness of government spending and desires for additional spending on a variety of government programs. Support for the Bush tax cuts was strongly shaped by people's attitudes about their own tax burdens, but virtually unaffected by their attitudes about the tax burden of the rich---even in the case of the estate tax, which only affects the wealthiest one or two percent of taxpayers. Public opinion in this instance was ill informed, insensitive to some of the most important implications of the tax cuts, and largely dis- connected from (or misconnected to) a variety of relevant values and material interests.},

@misc{Bradley2003,
	Abstract = {This article analyzes the processes of distribution and redistribution in postindustrial democracies. The authors combine a pooled time-series data base on welfare state effort and its determinants assembled by Huber, Ragin, and Stephens (1997) with data on income distribution assembled in the Luxembourg Income Survey (LIS) archive. In the case of the LIS data, the authors recalculate the microdata in order to remove the distorting influence of pensioners on pretax, pretransfer income distribution. They examine the determinants of two dependent variables: pretax, pretransfer income inequality and the proportional reduction in inequality from pre- to post-tax and transfer inequality. They test hypotheses derived from power resources theory against alternatives derived from the literature on the development of the welfare state and the determinants of income inequality. The results offer strong support for power resources theory, particularly in the case of reduction in inequality. Union density, unemployment, and percentage of female-headed households were the main determinants of pre-tax and transfer inequality ( \{$\backslash$rm R\}\^{}\{2\} = .64), while leftist government, directly and indirectly through its influence on the size of the welfare state, was found to be by far the strongest determinant of distribution ( \{$\backslash$rm R\}\^{}\{2\} = .81).},

This view is really a carry-over from the classical premise that the private sector is a self-regulating mechanism and that any government action beyond maintenance of law and order is "interference" with it rather than an intrinsic part of it.},

	Abstract = {Empirical findings concerns economic voting differ according to the level of analysis employed.  A widely acceped explanation for the inconsistency between macro- and micro-level evidence of economic voting is the high degree of random variation that plagues survey data.  According to this explanation, aggregation purges individual-level "noise" from mass opinions on policy issues and outcomes.  Building on the research of Bartels (1996), we debate the validity of this explanation by demonstration that public evaluations of the national economy vary systemmatically with information, media exposure, political attitudes, personal experiences, and demographic characteristics.  Furthermore, we show that these sources of subjective heterogeneity produce systematic biases when national economic evaluations are aggregated.  These findings challenge a widely accepted notion that because "error" in individual-level measures (or expressions) of preferences is random, the aggregation of these individual measures ensures that they correctly represent the collective preference.},

	Abstract = {"This book proposes a selection model for explaining cross-national variation in economic voting: Rational voters condition their economic vote on whether incumbents are responsible for economic outcomes because this is the optimal way to identify and elect competent economic managers under conditions of uncertainty. This model explores how political and economic institutions alter the quality of the signal that the previous economy provides about the competence of candidates. The rational economic voter is also attentive to strategic cues regarding the responsibility of parties for economic outcomes and their electoral competitiveness. Theoretical propositions are derived linking variation in economic and political institutions to variability in economic voting. The authors demonstrate that there is economic voting, and that it varies significantly across political contexts, and then test explanations for this variation derived from their theory. The data consist of 165 election studies conducted in 19 different countries over a 20-year time period."--BOOK JACKET.},

First, following the rational expectations literature in economics, a large sample of countries over a long time period O$\backslash$eN' I permits tests of the unbiasedness implication of the rational expectations hypotheses (REH), revealing much variation in the accuracy of expectations and the nature of the biases in expectations. Secondly, a theory of expectation formation encompassing the unbiasedness prediction of the REH and setting out the conditions under which economic expectations should be too optimistic or too pessimistic is elucidated. Zaller's theory of political attitude formation allows the identification of variables conditioning the accuracy of expectations across contexts, drawing a link between the thinking of political scientists and economists about expectation formation. Finally, the theoretical argument that political context impacts the accuracy of average expectations is tested},

Specifically, we maintain that political sophistica- tion dramatically influences the rela- tive importance of personal and na- tional economic judgments in shaping presidential candidate pref- erence. Pocketbook voting, we argue, should be common only among rela- tively sophisticated voters, who are able to make the associative linkage between changes in their personal financial status and governmental policy. Additionally, we hypothesize that sociotropic evaluations should be most influential for less sophisticated voters. Low sophisticates, we argue, will tend to assume that the national economy is entirely in the President's hands (and vote accordingly), whereas more sophisticated voters understand that the economy is af- fected by many actors and conditions that are largely beyond the Presi- dent's control. Testing our theory using data from 1992, 1996, and 1998, we find strong support for our hypotheses.},

	Abstract = {In terms of economic voting, voters' perceptions of economic indicators can be more important than the statistics themselves. This distinction is particularly important in understanding George Bush's defeat in 1992. Relentlessly negative reporting on economic performance during the election year negatively affected voters' perceptions of the economy. These altered perceptions influenced voting behavior. Ordinary least squares regression is used to demonstrate the media's impact on economic evaluations. Logistic regression is used to demonstrate the importance of economic evaluations in vote choice. Media consumption and attention to the presidential campaign through the mass media negatively shaped voters' retrospective economic assessments. These assessments were significantly related to vote choice. This suggests an explanation for why George Bush lost reelection despite an economy that had rebounded from recession well in advance of election day.},

Yet much of our knowledge about economic perceptions comes from political surveys conducted in the 1970s and 1980s. Past evidence has limited over-time variation, much of it predating the recent increase in income inequality. This paper updates our understanding of economic perceptions by combining the 1978-2003 Michigan Surveys of Consumer Attitudes with various economic indicators. Snapshots from elections create the impression that Americans' assessments of economic performance are influenced only by income growth among the wealthy. Examining 185,000 respondents to a monthly survey over 26 years, however, we learn that income growth among the poor is frequently more influential, especially among those with lower incomes themselves. Echoing findings of a ``rational public,'' Americans' aggregate economic assessments appear to be grounded in the economic conditions relevant to their levels of income.},

@article{Krause1997,
	Abstract = {Theory: It is argued here that previous studies analyzing the formation of voters' economic expectations overlook important subtleties found in a differentiated (heterogeneous) electorate. Since different segments of the electorate possess varying information capabilities, it is asserted that they will form their prospective economic evaluations differently from one another. Hypotheses: The impact of "expectational" electoral cycles, news coverage of the economy reported by voters, retrospective economic evaluations, and personal financial expectations are hypothesized to have a differential impact on their economic expectations based on varying levels of information (education) among subsets of the electorate. Methods: Time series multiple regression analysis is conducted for the monthly period between January 1978 and December 1990. The empirical analysis involves testing for the properties of the statistical time series (i.e., integration and cointegration) as well as specification of an error correction mechanism (ECM) that captures long-run statistical relationships in appropriate circumstances. Results: These findings uncover electoral heterogeneity (based on information/education differences) with respect to voters' prospective economic evaluations. Specifically, the information capabilities of voters is inversely related to their reliance on past/retrospective sources of information when forming both egocentric and sociotropic economic expectations. The main implication of this research is that the assumption of electoral homogeneity contained in previous longitudinal analyses of aggregate economic opinion formation provides misleading results that either overlook intra-electoral variations, introduce aggregation bias, or possibly both.},

	Abstract = {The usual mode of electoral reaction to economic conditions assumes the "retrospective" economic voter who bases expectations solely on recent economic performance or personal economic experience (voter as "peasant"). A second model assumes a "sophisticated" economic voter who incorporates new information about the future into personal economic expectations (voter as "banker"). Using the components, both retrospective and prospective, of the Index of Consumer Sentiment (ICS) as intervening variables between economic conditions and approval, we find that the prospective component fully accounts for the presideintial approval time series.With aggregate consumer expectations about long-term buisness conditions in the approval equation, neither the usual economic indicators not the other ICS componenets matter. Moreover, short-term changes in consumer expectations respond more to current forecasts than to the current econom. The qualitative result is a rational expectations outcome: the electorate anticipates the economic future and rewards or punishes the president for economic events before they happen.},

	Abstract = {Why is it that some countries have witnessed significant increases in inequality since the 1960s while at the same time experiencing very little change in the way politics is conducted? And why is it that in other countries, where inequality has increased much less, the Left has become substantially more redistributive? The answer, the authors argue, has to do with the interaction between inequality and political mobilization of low-income voters. The authors make two points in this article. First, high levels of inequality move Left parties to the left. Second, although increasing inequality pushes the core constituencies of Left parties to the left, it also makes some individuals less likely to be involved in politics. The authors argue that Left parties will respond to an increase in inequality only when low-income voters are politically mobilized. They explore these claims through a comparative analysis of Left party programs in 10 Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries over the period 1966 to 2002.},

The author argues that partisanship is not only$\backslash$nshaped by the traditionally suggested socio-economic factors, but$\backslash$nalso by the uncertainty of future income (risk exposure): rich individuals$\backslash$nfacing a high degree of risk exposure (or poor people facing low$\backslash$nrisk exposure) are `cross-pressured'; while their income suggests$\backslash$nthat they should identify with the Republicans, their income prospects$\backslash$nmake them sympathize with the Democrats. These two traits have overlapped$\backslash$nincreasingly since the 1970s. Those with lower incomes tend to be$\backslash$nalso those with higher risk exposure (risk inequality increased).$\backslash$nThis has led to a sorting of the American electorate: more citizens$\backslash$nhave become `natural' partisans. },

	Abstract = {A common claim in debates about globalization is that economic integration increases worker$\backslash$ninsecurity. Although this idea is central to both political and academic debates about$\backslash$ninternational economic integration, the theoretical basis of the claim is often not clear. There is$\backslash$nalso no empirical research that has directly tested the relationship. In this paper, we argue that economic insecurity among workers may be related to deteriorating employment and/or wage interactions with employers, and that foreign direct investment may a key factor contributing to this deterioration. We present new empirical evidence, based on the analysis of panel data from$\backslash$nGreat Britain collected from 1991-1999, that FDI activity in the industries in which individuals$\backslash$nwork is positively correlated with individual perceptions of economic insecurity. This relationship holds in yearly cross-sections, in a panel accounting for individual-specific effects, and in a dynamic panel model also accounting for individual-specific effects.},

	Abstract = {Strategies for reducing tax evasion include stricter enforcement, but taxpayer responses to increased enforcement are difficult to measure with field data. We use experimental methods to examine individual compliance responses to advance information on audit probability and productivity. Our design informs some individuals that their return will be audited prior to making their compliance decision, while other individuals receive information that they will not be audited; we also inform individuals of the productivity (fraction of unreported income discovered) of the audit. Announcement increases compliance of those told they will be audited, but reduces compliance of those knowing they will not be audited; the net effect is that overall compliance falls.

If the proposal was accepted, each group member received an equal share of his group�s payoff (the pie in the group condition was three times that in the individual condition). In both experiments, groups offered less than individuals. But as indicated by the low rejection rate in both treatments, groups were also willing to accept less.},

We derive and test competing predictions for the two dominant psychological theories of group polarisation in this context.

	Abstract = {Advocates hope to influence the resource allocation decisions of legislators and other policy makers to capture more resources for mental health programs. Findings from social psychological research suggest factors that, if pursued, may improve advocacy efforts. In particular, allocation decisions are affected by policy makers' perceptions of the scarcity of resources, effectiveness of specific programs, needs of people who have problems that are served by these programs, and extent of personal responsibility for these problems. These perceptions are further influenced by political ideology. Conservatives are motivated by a tendency to punish persons who. are perceived as having personal responsibility for their problems by withholding resources, whereas liberals are likely to avoid tough allocation decisions. Moreover, these perceptions are affected by political accountability, that is, whether politicians perceive that their constituents will closely monitor their decisions. just as the quality of clinical interventions improves when informed by basic research on human behavior, the efforts of mental health advocates will be advanced when they understand the psychological forces that affect policy makers' decisions about resources.},

Embeddedness can be so pronounced that outsiders no longer focus on the judgement and decision making of individuals contributing to the course of action. Instead, they ascribe the behaviour to the institution, which they refer to as a corporate actor. This social practice makes it meaningful to compare isolated individuals and corporate actors undertaking the same tasks.

	Abstract = {We use a laboratory experiment to compare the way groups and individuals behave in an inter-temporal common pool dilemma. The experimental design distinguishes between a non-strategic problem where players (individuals or groups of three) make decisions without interaction and a strategic part where players harvest from a common pool. This allows us to correct for differences between individuals and groups in the quality of decisions when testing for differences in competitiveness. Group decisions are either made by majority rule or unanimity. The results show that groups are less myopic than individuals (i.e., they make qualitatively better decisions) but that they are more competitive than individuals when placed in a strategic setting. The net result for groups deciding by majority rule is that they make less efficient decisions in the strategic game than individuals do. We are able to show that this is caused by the median voter departing from her original preference in early periods witha shrinking pool. When groups have to make unanimous decisions they start playing the strategic game more efficiently then individuals do, but they rapidly become more competitive with repetition of the game.

(c) Does accountability alter how people think or merely what people say they think? and (d) What goals do accountable decision makers seek to achieve? In addition, this review explores the broader implications of accountability research. It highlights the utility of treating thought as a process of internalized dialogue; the importance of documenting social and institutional boundary conditions on putative cognitive biases; and the potential to craft empirical answers to such applied problems as how to structure accountability relationships in organizations.},

Although the decision rule the committee used to decide whether to accept or reject the offer had a large effect on the optimal allocation strategy, we hypothesized that allocators would have difficulty incorporating the implications of the committee's decision rule into their allocation decisions. Experiment 1 found subjects to be very insensitive to decision rule. In fact, decision rule had no effect on allocation decisions. Experiment 2 made the decision rule and its implications more obvious to subjects, but allocations still deviated from the strategies that would have maximized winnings. Experiment 3 provided convincing evidence that the reasons for these deviations from the maximizing strategy have to do with insensitivity to the implications of the group's decision rule and with the difficulty in thinking accurately about the cognitions of others.

We experimentally tested two perspectives: "rational," where the other was expected to accept any amount offered because it would be better than nothing, and "fair," where the other was expected to use fairness as the criterion for evaluating the offer. The latter perspective implies a need to show greater cooperation, i.e., to make more generous ultimatum offers. The results supported the hypotheses that groups adopt more of a rational perspective than individuals, and that offers to outgroups reflect a rational perspective more than offers to ingroups. The preference of the most competitive individual in the group was the best predictor of the group's ultimatum offer. The perspective adopted by the group had lasting effects, as individuals tended to adopt the level of competitiveness of their groups in subsequent individual ultimatum games.

In order to assess whether the discontinuity effect is partially driven by the individual anonymity inherent in group decisions, a laboratory experiment was conducted in which group members' votes for the choices on a PDG-Alt matrix were, or were not, to be known by the members of the other group. The results indicated that group members who anticipated that their votes would be identified by the other group made fewer competitive choices and more cooperative choices. A number of different possible theoretical interpretations of these results were discussed. Separate results from a variety of assessments provided evidence for the fear and greed interpretation of discontinuity. It was found, for example, that discussions between groups contained more distrust and greed statements than did discussions between individuals. (C) 1995 Academic Press, Inc.},

abstract ={This paper presents the results of two randomized experiments conducted in schools in urban India. A remedial education program hired young women to teach students lagging behind in basic literacy and numeracy skills. It increased average test scores of all children in treatment schools by 0.28 standard deviation, mostly due to large gains experienced by children at the bottom of the test-score distribution. A computer-assisted learning program focusing on math increased math scores by 0.47 standard deviation. One year after the programs were over, initial gains remained significant for targeted children, but they faded to about 0.10 standard deviation.},

	Abstract = {Person perception includes three sequential processes: categorization (what is the actor doing?), characterization (what trait does the action imply?), and correction (what situational constraints may have caused the action?). We argue that correction is less automatic (i.e., more easily disrupted) than either categorization or characterization. In Experiment 1, subjects observed a target behave anxiously in an anxiety-provoking situation. In Experiment 2, subjects listened to a target read a political speech that he had been constrained to write. In both experiments, control subjects used information about situational constraints when drawing inferences about the target, but cognitively busy subjects (who performed an additional cognitive task during encoding) did not. The results (a) suggest that person perception is a combination of lower and higher order processes that differ in their susceptibility to disruption and (b) highlight the fundamental differences between active and passive perceivers.},

The attribution theory is related to studies of social perception, self-perception, and psychological epistemology. Two systematic statements of attribution theory are described, discussed, and illustrated with empirical data: the covariation and the configuration concepts. Some problems for attribution theory are considered, including the interplay between preconceptions and new information, simple vs. complex schemata, attribution of covariation among causes, and illusions in attributions. The role of attribution in decision making and behavior is discussed.},

@book{ross91,
	Abstract = {In summary, this is a book about the predictability and coherence of behavior as seen from the perspective of modern experimental and cognitive social psychology. We begin with the history of research suggesting that situational factors often prove to be more powerful determinants of behavior that the vast majority of us�scientists and laypeople alike�would have guessed. Implicit in this situationist lesson is the suggestion that people from different backgrounds, people with different beliefs, even people with apparently different personalities, must understand and react to some situations rather uniformly.

At the same time, research and everyday observation constantly remind us that people often do differ dramatically both in their responses to particular situations and events and in the patterns of their everyday behavior. We will argue that the shared convictions that laypeople have about stable, consistent, coherent, and predictable individual differences are not always mere cognitive illusions. Rather, they are based, at least to a substantial degree, on the data of everyday experience. Far from disputing the existence or significance of individual differences, we will acknowledge them and then explore their bases and implications. More specifically, we will provide a "situationist" and "subjectivist" account of individual differences�one that gives heavy weight to the complex dynamics of social systems and to the role of construal processes. Our goal will thus be an account of individual differences that seeks to explain what kinds of differences are likely to exist and be important, when they are likely to be obscured, and when misinterpretations of such differences are likely to arise.},

	Abstract = {Attribution theories have not specified whether attributions are made by perceivers as part of the process of comprehending an event or only later in response to specific attributional questions. Theories also disagree about the types of attributional inferences (judgments of causation, of the actor's traits, or of intentionality) that are most likely to be made initially and to mediate further inferences. Whereas previous research has been unable to address these issues, a design using 2 RT measures provided relevant evidence. Results of 2 studies involving 100 undergraduates show that judgments of intention and of the actor's traits may have been made in the process of comprehension; affective judgments and inferences about the repetition of an event and the event's personal or situational causation were probably made later. Implications for a model of schema-based attributional inference are discussed.},

	Abstract = {We present a unified model of turnout and vote choice that incorporates two distinct motivations for citizens to abstain from voting: alienation from the candidates, and indifference between the candidates. Empirically, we find that alienation and indifference each motivated significant amounts of voter abstention in the 1980-1988 U.S. presidential elections. Using model-based computer simulations-which permit us to manipulate factors affecting turnout-we show that distinguishing between alienation and indifference illuminates three controversies in elections research. First, we find that abstention because of either alienation or indifference benefited Republican candidates, but only very modestly. Second, presidential elections involving attractive candidates motivate higher turnout, but only to the extent that abstention stems from alienation rather than from indifference. Third, paradoxically, citizens' individual-level tendencies to abstain because of alienation are strongly affected by their evaluations of the candidates' policies, whereas aggregate turnout rates do not depend significantly on the candidates' policy platforms.},

@article{Barnard:1999ws,
	Abstract = {An appealing feature of multiple imputation is he simplicity of the
	rules for combining the multiple complete-data inferences into a
	final inference, the repeated-imputation inference (Rubin, 1987).
	This inference is based on a t distribution and is derived from a
	Bayesian paradigm under the assumption that the complete-data degrees
	of freedom, νcom, are infinite, but the number of imputations, m,
	is finite. When νcom is small and there is only a modest proportion
	of missing data, the calculated repeated-imputation degrees of freedom,
	νm, for the t reference distribution can be much larger than νcom,
	which is clearly inappropriate. Following the Bayesian paradigm,
	we derive an adjusted degrees of freedom, ν̃m, with the following
	three properties: for fixed m and estimated fraction of missing information,
	ν̃m monotonically increases in νcom; ν̃m is always less than or equal
	to νcom; and ν̃m equals νm when νcom is infinite. A small simulation
	study demonstrates the superior frequentist performance when using
	ν̃m rather than νm.},

	Abstract = {This paper examines the validity of predominant assumptions about
	popular support for the welfare state. These presuppositions include
	the notion that support for the welfare state varies in different
	types of regimes (be they `liberal' or `social democratic' or `conservative'),
	the idea that different social groups (for example, the middle and
	working classes and the unemployed) have different interests with
	respect to the welfare state, and the view that political alignments
	have a strong influence on attitudes to welfare. To investigate these
	issues we analyze the 1990 International Social Survey Programme
	Role of Government Survey and compare it to the findings of an analysis
	we conducted on the 1985 survey. The aim therefore is to examine
	the relationship between mass attitudes and specific types of welfare
	state regime and the social and other correlates of mass opinion},

	Abstract = {This study analyzes the effects of income on voting behavior and the outcome of presidential elections in the U.S. since 1952. The political effects of income have not been examined using appropriate measures and systematic analysis of individual-level data. Our analyses build from political behavior research on economic evaluations and sociological and economic research on trends in income distribution. We first consider the theoretical grounds for expecting income to have shaped voting behavior in the postwar era. Our analysis then shows that while income has had a significant and generally stable impact on voting behavior, cumulative changes in mean household income have had a very large effect on the outcome of presidential elections since the 1950s, with Republican candidates benefiting disproportionately. We find that household income shapes voting behavior indirectly, affecting policy evaluations, which in turn influence vote choice. The mediating roles played by evaluations of social welfare and government size help to explain why past increases in mean income have consistently benefited the Republican party. We discuss the contributions of this study to understanding income as an important but underappreciated source of political change in the U.S.},

Analysis of cross-country survey data reveals that this correlation disappears among religious individuals in countries that use proportional representation. This is the case in large part because there is a moral values dimension that has a correlation with income that is equal in magnitude but has the opposite sign as the economic dimension, and the votes of the religious are better explained by their positions on moral than economic issues, especially in countries with multiparty systems. The authors conclude by discussing implications for theories of redistribution.},

@article{Finseraas2009,
	Abstract = {This article employs multilevel modeling to assess the importance
	of income inequality on the demand for redistribution in a sample
	of 22 European countries. According to standard political economy
	models of redistribution -- notably the Meltzer-Richard model --
	inequality and demand for redistribution should be positively linked.
	However, existing empirical research has disputed this claim. The
	main advantages of this article is that demand for redistribution
	is measured at the individual level, and that the relevant interaction
	between inequality and own income is considered. The main findings
	are that inequality is positively associated with demand for redistribution,
	and that the median income person is sensitive to the level of inequality.
	These findings are robust to the inclusion of a range of relevant
	control variables. The results are relevant in relation to the increase
	in inequalities in many European countries, and especially relevant
	to the current debate about the importance of directly observable
	differences in public preferences for social policy outcomes.},

	Abstract = {Britain and Germany have been experiencing significant changes in
	the nature of work and welfare since the 1990s. Although important
	differences have remained, there have been compelling indications
	of a dual transformation of welfare constituted not only by a far-reaching
	retrenchment in unemployment insurance but also by a remarkable expansion
	in family policy. These developments have their functional underpinnings
	in accelerating deindustrialization with a declining proportion of
	the male workforce with specific skills as well as in service sector
	growth and rising female labor market participation characterized
	by an increase in general skills. As the aggregate effect of economic
	fluctuations in industrial production has diminished over time, the
	relative incidence of work disruptions that have arisen from maternity
	and child-rearing has increased substantially. This dual transformation
	in welfare and employment patterns suggests that the process of deindustrialization
	has initiated significant path adjustments unanticipated in the existing
	comparative political economy literature.},

We analyze two-outcome and multiple-outcome models, including ordered and unordered choice models. We allow for transition-specific and general instruments. We generalize previous analyses by developing weights for treatment effects for general instruments. We develop a simple test for the presence of essential heterogeneity. We note the asymmetry of the model of essential heterogeneity: outcomes of choices are heterogeneous in a general way; choices are not. When both choices and outcomes are permitted to be symmetrically heterogeneous, the method of IV breaks down for estimating treatment parameters.},

	Abstract = {Ecological inference is a statistical problem where aggregate-level data are used to make inferences about individual-level behavior. In this article, we conduct a theoretical and empirical study of Bayesian and likelihood inference for 2 x 2 ecological tables by applying the general statistical framework of incomplete data. We first show that the ecological inference problem can be decomposed into three factors: distributional effects, which address the possible misspecification of parametric modeling assumptions about the unknown distribution of missing data; contextual effects, which represent the possible correlation between missing data and observed variables; and aggregation effects, which are directly related to the loss of information caused by data aggregation. We then examine how these three factors affect inference and offer new statistical methods to address each of them. To deal with distributional effects, we propose a nonparametric Bayesian model based on a Dirichlet process prior, which relaxes common parametric assumptions. We also identify the statistical adjustments necessary to account for contextual effects. Finally, although little can be done to cope with aggregation effects, we offer a method to quantify the magnitude of such effects in order to formally assess its severity. We use simulated and real data sets to empirically investigate the consequences of these three factors and to evaluate the performance of our proposed methods. C code, along with an easy-to-use R interface, is publicly available for implementing our proposed methods (Imai, Lu, and Strauss, forthcoming).},

@article{ImaiKeeleTingley2010,
	Abstract = {Traditionally in the social sciences, causal mediation analysis has been formulated, understood, and implemented within the framework of linear structural equation models. We argue and demonstrate that this is problematic for 3 reasons: the lack of a general definition of causal mediation effects independent of a particular statistical model, the inability to specify the key identification assumption, and the difficulty of extending the framework to nonlinear models. In this article, we propose an alternative approach that overcomes these limitations. Our approach is general because it offers the definition, identification, estimation, and sensitivity analysis of causal mediation effects without reference to any specific statistical model. Further, our approach explicitly links these 4 elements closely together within a single framework. As a result, the proposed framework can accommodate linear and nonlinear relationships, parametric and nonparametric models, continuous and discrete mediators, and various types of outcome variables. The general definition and identification result also allow us to develop sensitivity analysis in the context of commonly used models, which enables applied researchers to formally assess the robustness of their empirical conclusions to violations of the key assumption. We illustrate our approach by applying it to the Job Search Intervention Study. We also offer easy-to-use software that implements all our proposed methods.},

@article{IversenSoskice2001,
	Abstract = {We present a theory of social policy preferences that emphasizes the
	composition of people's skills. The key to our argument is that individuals
	who have made risky investments in skills will demand insurance against
	the possible future loss of income from those investments. Because
	the transferability of skills is inversely related to their specificity,
	workers with specific skills face a potentially long spell of unemployment
	or a significant decline in income in the event of job loss. Workers
	deriving most of their income from specific skills therefore have
	strong incentives to support social policies that protect them against
	such uncertainty. This is not the case for general skills workers,
	for whom the costs of social protection weigh more prominently. We
	test the theory on public opinion data for eleven advanced democracies
	and suggest how differences in educational systems can help explain
	cross-national differences in the level of social protection.},

	Abstract = {Previous sociological studies have paid little attention to religion
	as a central determinant of individual preferences for redistribution.
	In this article we argue that religious individuals, living in increasingly
	secular societies, differ in political preferences from their secular
	counterparts. Based on the theory of religious cleavages, we expect
	that religious individuals will oppose income redistribution by the
	state. Furthermore, in contexts where the polarization between religious
	and secular individuals is large, preferences for redistribution
	will be lower. In the empirical analysis we test our predictions
	in a multilevel framework, using data from the European Social Survey
	2002--2006 for 16 Western European countries. After controlling for
	a wide range of individual socio-economic factors and for welfare-state
	policies, religion plays and important explanatory role. We find
	that both Catholics and Protestants strongly oppose income redistribution
	by the state. The cleavage between religious and secular individuals
	is far more important than the difference between denominations.
	Using a refined measure of religious polarization, we also find that
	in more polarized context the overall level of support for redistribution
	is lower.},

@book{AngristPischke2008,
	Abstract = {The core methods in today's econometric toolkit are linear regression for statistical control, instrumental variables methods for the analysis of natural experiments, and differences-in-differences methods that exploit policy changes. In the modern experimentalist paradigm, these techniques address clear causal questions such as: Do smaller classes increase learning? Should wife batterers be arrested? How much does education raise wages? Mostly Harmless Econometrics shows how the basic tools of applied econometrics allow the data to speak. In addition to econometric essentials, Mostly Harmless Econometrics covers important new extensions--regression-discontinuity designs and quantile regression--as well as how to get standard errors right. Joshua Angrist and J{\"o}rn-Steffen Pischke explain why fancier econometric techniques are typically unnecessary and even dangerous. The applied econometric methods emphasized in this book are easy to use and relevant for many areas of contemporary social science. An irreverent review of econometric essentials A focus on tools that applied researchers use most Chapters on regression-discontinuity designs, quantile regression, and standard errors Many empirical examples A clear and concise resource with wide applications},

@book{McCarthyPooleRosenthal2008,
	Abstract = {The idea of America as politically polarized---that there is an unbridgeable
	divide between right and left, red and blue states---has become a
	clich{\'e}. What commentators miss, however, is that increasing polarization
	in recent decades has been closely accompanied by fundamental social
	and economic changes---most notably, a parallel rise in income inequality.
	In Polarized America, Nolan McCarty, Keith Poole, and Howard Rosenthal
	examine the relationships of polarization, wealth disparity, immigration,
	and other forces, characterizing it as a dance of give and take and
	back and forth causality. Using NOMINATE (a quantitative procedure
	that, like interest group ratings, scores politicians on the basis
	of their roll call voting records) to measure polarization in Congress
	and public opinion, census data and Federal Election Commission finance
	records to measure polarization among the public, the authors find
	that polarization and income inequality fell in tandem from 1913
	to 1957 and rose together dramatically from 1977 on; they trace a
	parallel rise in immigration beginning in the 1970s. They show that
	Republicans have moved right, away from redistributive policies that
	would reduce income inequality. Immigration, meanwhile, has facilitated
	the move to the right: non-citizens, a larger share of the population
	and disproportionately poor, cannot vote; thus there is less political
	pressure from the bottom for redistribution than there is from the
	top against it. In "the choreography of American politics" inequality
	feeds directly into political polarization, and polarization in turn
	creates policies that further increase inequality.},

	Abstract = {One important puzzle in international political economy is why lower-earning and less-skilled intensive industries tend to receive relatively high levels of trade protection.  This pattern of protection holds even in low-income countries in which less-skilled labor is likely to be the relatively abundant factor of production and therefore would be expected in many standard political-economy frameworks to receive relatively low, not high, levels of protection.  We propose and model one possible explanation: that individual aversion to inequality---both envy and altruism---lead to systematic differences in support for trade protection across industries, with sectors employing lower-earning workers more intensively being relatively preferred recipients for trade protection.  We conduct original survey experiments in China and the United States and provide strong evidence that individual policy opinions about sector-specific trade protection depend on the earnings of workers in the sector.  We also present structural estimates of the influence of envy and altruism on sector-specific trade policy preferences.  Our estimates indicate that both envy and altruism influence support for trade protection in the United States and that altruism influences policy opinions in China.},

In the context of the 2009 German federal election, we conducted a sentiment analysis of over 100,000 messages containing a reference to either a political party or a politician. Our results show that Twitter is used extensively for political deliberation and that the mere number of party mentions accurately reflects the election result. The tweets' sentiment (e.g., positive and negative emotions associated with a politician) corresponds closely to voters' political preferences. In addition, party sentiment profiles reflect the similarity of political positions between parties. We derive suggestions for further research and discuss the use of microblogging services to aggregate dispersed information.},

abstract = {Social Media contain a multitude of user opinions which can be used to predict real-world phenomena in many domains including politics, finance and health. Most existing methods treat these problems as linear regression, learning to relate word frequencies and other simple features to a known response variable (e.g., voting intention polls or financial indicators). These techniques require very careful filtering of the input texts, as most Social Media posts are irrelevant to the task. In this paper, we present a novel approach which performs high quality filtering automatically, through modelling not just words but also users, framed as a bilinear model with a sparse regulariser. We also consider the problem of modelling groups of related output variables, using a structured multi-task regularisation method. Our experiments on voting intention prediction demonstrate strong performance over large-scale input from Twitter on two distinct case studies, significantly outperforming competitive baselines.},
